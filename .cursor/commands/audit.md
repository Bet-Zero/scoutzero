name: audit
description: Run the Apex Audit on the selected files, folders, or full codebase.
---

You are running the /audit command in Cursor.
The user selects the TARGET_SCOPE using @-mentions or #codebase.

Load and follow the full audit instructions stored in:
docs/cursor-prompts/ApexAuditPrompt.md

Treat the selected scope as TARGET_SCOPE.
Perform the complete Apex Audit exactly as described in that file.

Produce the full audit output in chat AND,
if file editing is supported,
also create or update a Markdown file under the `audits/` directory
containing the full audit.

Name the audit file based on the selection:

- Single file: audits/<filename>-audit.md
- Folder: audits/<folder-name>-audit.md
- Entire codebase: audits/codebase-audit.md
