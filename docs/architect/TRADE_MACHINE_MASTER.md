# TRADE_MACHINE_MASTER

Last updated: 2026-02-26

## Trade Machine Overview

`validateTrade` is the canonical legality gate for Trade Machine proposals. It guarantees:

- Deterministic validation for each participating team using the same routed asset view used by apply-time flows.
- Routing legality for outgoing assets (players, entitlements, and cash where modeled):
  - In multi-team trades (3+ teams), every outgoing asset must have an explicit destination team.
- Ownership and structural legality checks before trade commit (including entitlement routing and linkage checks).
- Salary/cap/apron rule evaluation using computed incoming/outgoing values per team.
- Fail-closed behavior: unresolved invariant/routing errors block legality.

## Test Gates

Primary gate:

- `npm run test:trade -- --reporter=dot`

Secondary confidence gates for this area:

- `npm run test:architect -- --reporter=dot`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run validate:project`

## Known Baseline Failures

None.

## E1 — Trade Test Gate Stabilization

### What Was Fixed

1. Repaired 3+ team route-aware incoming player and salary calculations in `tradeValidator` so validation does not treat incoming assets as broadcast from all other teams.
2. Standardized team identity and player destination resolution across:
   - route checks
   - salary matching
   - summary generation
   - entitlement-routing-adjacent team identity usage
3. Updated stale 3-team fixtures to include explicit player destinations so pre-validation routing checks do not mask downstream rule evaluation.
4. Added a targeted regression test ensuring second-apron incoming-salary restrictions in 3-team trades use routed incoming values rather than broadcast assumptions.

### Clarified Rules (LOCKED)

#### A) Multi-team routing requirement (3+ teams)

- In 3+ team trades, **outgoing players must have explicit destination routing**.
- **Definition:** every outgoing player must specify a destination team via the canonical destination field.
- Trades that violate this fail early with routing legality errors (by design), and downstream rules (salary/apron/etc.) must not be expected to run if routing is incomplete.

#### B) Canonical destination field (and supported aliases)

- **Canonical destination field:** `toTeamId`
- Supported aliases (backward compatibility only): `tradeTo`, `destTeamId`
- New call sites and new fixtures should use `toTeamId`. Aliases exist only to tolerate older shapes.

#### C) Two-team routing legacy fallback (2 teams only)

- In 2-team trades, missing player destination uses a **legacy backward-compatible fallback** behavior.
- This fallback is **not** valid for 3+ team trades and must not be expanded to multi-team behavior.
- New code and fixtures should still supply `toTeamId` for clarity even in 2-team cases.

#### C.1) Apply-time fail-closed routing invariant (3+ teams)

- Apply-time snapshot building now enforces the same 3+ destination requirement as validator routing.
- If any outgoing player in a 3+ team trade has missing/invalid destination routing, apply fails loudly with `TRADE_APPLY_ROUTING_ERROR`.
- No partial apply writes are committed when this invariant fails.

#### D) Second apron incoming salary restriction (route-aware)

- The “second apron team cannot receive more salary than it sends” restriction is evaluated using **routed incoming salary**.
- In 3+ team trades, only explicitly routed incoming players count toward incoming salary. There is no broadcast/implicit incoming behavior.

#### E) Entitlement legality remains fail-closed

- Entitlement invariants remain fail-closed and are not bypassed by trade validation:
  - league claim uniqueness protections
  - linked package completeness enforcement
  - resolver invariant violation protections

### Current Test Gate Status

- `npm run test:trade -- --reporter=dot`: PASS
- `npm run test:architect -- --reporter=dot`: PASS
- `npm run build`: PASS
- `npm run validate:project`: PASS

## E1 — Sign-And-Trade (S&T) Fail-Closed Alignment

### Canonical Eligibility Definition (SSOT)

S&T eligibility is resolved through:

- `src/features/architect/utils/tradeMachine/signAndTrade/signAndTradeEligibility.ts`

Authoritative status outcomes:

- `UNDER_CONTRACT`
- `FREE_AGENT`
- `CAP_HOLD`
- `UNKNOWN`

Eligibility rule:

- S&T is legal only for `FREE_AGENT` or `CAP_HOLD`.
- `UNDER_CONTRACT` and `UNKNOWN` fail closed.
- Source-team alignment must be valid (team reference and/or active cap-hold evidence).

### Required S&T Contract Payload Shape

Any outgoing S&T asset must include canonical payload on the send entry:

- `send.signAndTrade = true`
- `send.signAndTradeContract.salariesByYear[]`
- `send.signAndTradeContract.contractYears`
- `send.signAndTradeContract.firstYearGuaranteed`
- `send.tradeTo` (destination)

Canonical row shape:

- `{ season, salary, capHit, guaranteed }`

### Trade Machine Capture Flow

Trade Machine S&T is contract-capture first:

- Clicking `Sign-and-Trade` opens contract modal.
- User must provide destination + valid contract.
- State is only written after modal confirm:
  - `send.signAndTrade`
  - `send.signAndTradeContract`
  - `send.tradeTo`

Cancellation writes nothing.

### Validator / Apply Parity Guarantee

Validator and apply-time use the same S&T helpers:

- `isSignAndTradeEligible(...)`
- `resolveSignAndTradeContractPayload(...)`
- `validateSignAndTradeContractPayload(...)`

Salary matching parity:

- Matching values use S&T first-year salary from `signAndTradeContract.salariesByYear[]` when `signAndTrade` is active.

### Apply-Time Atomic Semantics

Execute-trade apply now enforces S&T preflight before writes:

- missing/invalid destination -> block
- ineligible player status -> block
- missing/invalid S&T contract payload -> block

On success, same atomic mutation path applies:

- player move
- S&T contract persistence on receiving player snapshot
- source cap-hold removal for that player
- receiver hard-cap trigger metadata

No partial commit is allowed when S&T preflight fails.

### Hard-Cap Consequence Representation

Receiving an S&T player sets hard-cap fields on receiver snapshot:

- `team.hardCapped = 1` (or preserves stronger pre-existing level)
- `team.hardCapTriggered = 'SignAndTrade'`
- `team.hardCapFirstApron.active = true`
- `team.totals.isHardCapped = true`
- `team.totals.hardCapLevel = 'firstApron'` (unless already second-apron constrained)
